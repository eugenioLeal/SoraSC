Example using meld (merge & diff tool)
Take into account that this command is just a convenience command and is not necessary. Just use 

sora incorporate-changes-from main_john_doe.c --with-tool meld


## Visual Studio

You can invoke it directly from Visual Studio Command Prompt:

devenv /diff file1.txt file2.txt

This opens the built-in diff viewer.

For merges (3-way):
devenv /merge base.txt theirs.txt mine.txt output.txt

Works with any plain files ‚Äî no Git required!

Or through the GUI:
	‚Ä¢	File ‚Üí Compare Files‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	Select any two local files.
	‚Ä¢	Then click ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù if both files have edits.


## Vim Neovim
nvim -d base.txt ours.txt theirs.txt

You‚Äôll get three splits; you can choose what to copy where using the same do / dp commands.
